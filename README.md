# Template Engine

## Description

The template Engine is a team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

## User Story

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Installation

User would have to first utilize 'npm install' to download dependencies. After, you must go into the Develop Folder and then type 'node app.js' Follow the prompts and when you entered your last employee's info, an HTML page will populate into your output folder. 

## Roadmap

As I continue to work on this project, I would like for the HTML to dynamically update accordingly to the amount of team members that the user has put it

## Contributing
